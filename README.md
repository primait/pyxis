# Achille Design System





### Rules:

- Css rules sorted by **alphabetic** order
- *@include*(s) and *@extend*(s) after pure rules
- No more than two nesting levels
- No implicit rules
- No vendor prefixes
- Atoms must be **predictable** and **independent** 
- Atoms must have only internal spacing
- Atoms must have active modifiers *(i.e. is-active, is-selected )*
- Stay **DRY**



#### ToDo List:

- Atoms:

  - One-rule helpers 
  - Buttons
  - Typography
  - Form inputs
  - Colors
  - Spacing & grid
  - Icons

- Molecules

- Organisms

- Templates

- Pages
